# Weight-Tracker-App
## Final Project: Category Three Narrative
The artifact is my project from CS 360. The project consists of a mobile application called Weight Tracker. This mobile application was intended to track users' weight and provide a table of their weight to them. 
The project uses Android Studio and the emulator to show the app. I created this only 4 months ago and put it on GitHub in March of 2025.

I included this artifact because it’s the embodiment of category three and fits. I selected this item because I knew it could use improvement and enhancements. When I turned this project in, I couldn’t get the 
emulator to show the application, but once I researched my issue, I found the solution. The issues with the application should have been resolved when I first turned the project in, but I had trouble finding the 
answers. The artifact shows how I can improve from my past work and past thought processes. The artifact is installed in the emulator and can register/log into an account. I was able to create a MySQL database 
through XAMPP, which was separated from the Android Studio app. I created PHP files that connected to the database as a middleman to communicate with the app. The app is a lot more user-friendly, and there is a 
theme to it. A user can add weight, update weight, and delete weight. The user’s home screen shows them the current weight (most recent entered). If the user has not added weight, it shows “N/A”.

I did meet the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement. The course outcomes I met were 4 and 5:
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry
specific goals.

- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data 
and resources.  

Reflecting on the process, I noticed how exciting it can be when your artifact comes to life and you’re able to improve on it. I learned there are always others who have the same issues and many who know how to 
fix them. There is a lot of testing and debugging necessary to create a fully enhanced and modified project. I faced time constraint challenges and bugs/issues that I fixed through testing.
